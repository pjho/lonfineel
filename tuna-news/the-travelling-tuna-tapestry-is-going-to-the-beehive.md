		<p>When:&nbsp; <strong>Tuesday, March 19th</strong>, <strong>meet between 10:00</strong> <strong>am &#8211; 12 noon</strong>
			<br /> Where: <strong>Meet at Parliament, NOT at Te Papa as previously planned.</strong></p>
		<p>The <strong>magnificent longfin eel</strong>, found only in New Zealand and with a more serious conservation status than the little spotted kiwi is at risk of extinction and needs your help!</p>
		<p>Over the past few years hundreds of New Zealanders have been involved in the creation of the magnificent Tuna Tapestry and the distribution and signing of a petition to impose a moratorium on the commercial fishing of the iconic species.</p>
		<p>It all comes together next week, on <strong>Tuesday March 19<sup>th</sup></strong>.&nbsp; Join us as we <strong>march to Parliament</strong> and shepherd the tuna tapestry and the petition to parliament and make our voices heard!</p>
		<p>We will meet at the end of the driveway that leads up to Parliament from Lambton Quay anytime between 10:00 AM – 12 noon.&nbsp; At 12:30 we will carry the tapestry and the petition up the driveway, while local band Bella Cajon plays our opening music and the press arrives.</p>
		<p>We will hold the tapestry up in front of Parliament from 1 – 1:30 PM.&nbsp; During this time we will have speeches and pose for press photos.&nbsp; At 1:45 PM, when we will march back down the drive to our closing music from Bella Cajon.</p>
		<p>Come on down, use your lunch break, bring the family and help us save the longfin eel before it’s too late!</p>
