<h3>Why Should We Act Now to Ensure the Survival of the Eel?</h3>
<p>
	<a href="/images/IMG_0275.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-118" title="" src="/images/IMG_0275-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/images/IMG_0275-200x300.jpg 200w, /images/IMG_0275-683x1024.jpg 683w, /images/IMG_0275-100x150.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>The longfin eel (tuna) is of great national and international importance. New Zealand is&nbsp; the only home to this mysterious and biologically unique species, but we are now facing its possible extinction due to short sighted governance, exploitation for commercial reasons, and&nbsp; negative human environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The further decline of this species could have unknown wider food chain impacts. Because of its ecological role as a top predator , its removal could result in changes in the structure of&nbsp; fish communities and wetland food webs<sup><a href='#footnotes'>1</a></sup>. “They are also important in preserving natural predator-prey inter-relationships and supporting aquatic biodiversity” <sup><a href='#footnotes'>2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, as Joy and McEwan point out, from a purely economic point of view, it doesn’t make financial sense to fish the Longfin Eel:

	<p>In 2006, NZ export earnings from the eel fishery (shortfin and longfin) were $6,133,352. Longfin comprised approximately 25% of the commercial eel catch in 2006. Thus, earnings from export of longfin eels constitute approximately 25% of $6,133,352 -i.e. $1,533,338. This equates to 0.0009% of GDP (NZ$155.672 billion for that year). In recent years the Ministry of Fisheries has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on managing and researching this problematic fishery – effort not in keeping with the low value of the fishery itself.<sup><a href="#footnotes">3</a></sup></p>

<h3>What Measures Can We Take to Curb the Decline and Protect the Species?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Stop the commercial take of longfin eels &#8211; <a class="ceebox" title="Sign our petition - hosted by Forest and Bird. Click the cross at top-right to return to Manaaki Tuna. Thanks for signing our petition." href="http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/saving-our-environment/freshwater-/lifeline-longfins#pledge-user-form">support the moratorium.</a></li>
	<li>Keep cattle out of wetlands and waterways: they can trample banks, put excrement into the water, and eat the reeds which support the insect species that eels feed on.<sup><a href='#footnotes'>4</a></sup></li>
	<li>Let habitats regenerate: let land return to wetlands.<sup><a href='#footnotes'>5</a></sup></li>
	<li>Opening floodgates at strategic times of the year: helps ensure that migration and breeding cycles of native fish which eels feed on are not interrupted.</li>
	<li>Controlling noxious weeds can help eel populations.<sup><a href='#footnotes'>6</a></sup></li>
	<li>Remove dams and barriers, or at the very least stop the development of any new projects.</li>
	<li>Stop polluting activities- better management of effects of human activities on waterways.</li>
	<li>Let them go: especially the large female longfins. If we keep removing the scarce females out of the eel life cycle we will put at risk the survival of the whole species.<sup><a href='#footnotes'>7</a></sup></li>
	<li>Befriend the eels, and learn from them: you’ll find they are intelligent, interesting and gentle animals- and well worth protecting.</li>
