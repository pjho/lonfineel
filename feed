								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Manaaki Tuna petition (signed by over 6750 people) was delivered to Parliament on March 19th 2013, accompanied by the 150 metre Travelling Tuna Tapestry. The tapestry, made of recycled cloth, was initiated by Stephanie Bowman, a science and art environmental educator, who worked with schools and communities throughout NZ to raise awareness of the tuna&#8217;s biological and cultural significance. Thousands of people helped create the tapestry and it was displayed in public places around the country.</p>
<p>A submission by Manaaki Tuna in support of the petition was prepared and is now before the Primary Production Select Committee. Evidence will be presented later this year. The petition&#8217;s focus (calling on the Minister of Primary Industries to place a moratorium on the commercial fishing of the longfin eel) has generated a high degree of public debate over the past year, and media articles, television programs, and responses from scientists, and public officials have kept the issue in the public eye. The Maori Party, Labour Party and Green Party have all publicly supported the aim of the petition.</p>
<p>In April 2013, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment released a report &#8220;On a pathway to extinction: An investigation into the status and management of the longfin eel&#8221;. Recommendations include suspending the commercial catch of longfins, the protection of eel passage and habitat, and setting up an independent review of scientific advice on the status of the longfin eel population. The Parliamentary Commissioner&#8217;s report can be accessed at:<br />
<a href="http://www.pce.parliament.nz/publications/all-publications/on-a-pathway-to-extinction-an-investigation-into-the-status-and-management-of-the-longfin-eel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.pce.parliament.nz/publications/all-publications/on-a-pathway-to-extinction-an-investigation-into-the-status-and-management-of-the-longfin-eel</a></p>
<p>In June, 2013 The Minister of Primary Production, and the Minister of Conservation announced an interim response to the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment&#8217;s report on longfin eels. The recommendation to establish an independent, international peer review panel to reassess the data on longfin eels is being implemented, and a decision on whether to suspend commercial fishing of the species will be made once the final assessment from the independent panel is received in November 2013. The response can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/interim-measures-longfin-eels-announced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/interim-measures-longfin-eels-announced</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article was kindly written and supplied by Donna Palmer of Te Awamutu Intermediate.</p>
<p>Room 6, Te Awamutu Intermediate, went on a class trip to see the ‘We Love Eels’ exhibition at Te Awamutu Museum. The students were moved by what they discovered about the Longfin eel, and were disappointed that they could not sign the petition (being under 18 years old). Back in the classroom, the students hit on a plan.</p>
<p>They would create a banner and get all the students at school to sign it, in a way, creating their own petition, urging the government to make the Longfin eel a protected species. It was explained that if you ask people to sign their name to something, it was important that they know what they are signing for. They must be informed and educated about the issue, and then be allowed to make a decision for themselves. The question then was, how can we pass on to the rest of the school what we have learned about the Longfin eel? Another plan was hatched by the students!</p>
<div id="attachment_222" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/students.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-222" class="size-large wp-image-222" title="Room 6 - Te Awamutu Intermediate" src="http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/students-640x362.png" alt="Save the Long Fin" width="640" height="362" srcset="http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/students-640x362.png 640w, http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/students-300x169.png 300w, http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/students-150x84.png 150w, http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/students.png 967w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-222" class="wp-caption-text">Students from Room 6, with Claire Ashmore from the Te Awamutu Museum, and their teacher, Donna Palmer</p></div>
<p>Essentially, they hijacked the school assembly&#8230;peacefully it must be noted. They carried out a multimedia presentation. The School Council were netted up, representing the Longfin eels which are caught and harvested. Replica Longfin eels were displayed , and one student had the whole school enthralled as he was carried in , wriggling in a large sack. Many students are still convinced that there was an actual Longfin on stage.</p>
<div id="attachment_223" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/signing-the-eel.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223" class="size-medium wp-image-223" title="Students signing the banner" src="http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/signing-the-eel-300x238.png" alt="Students signing the banner" width="300" height="238" srcset="http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/signing-the-eel-300x238.png 300w, http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/signing-the-eel-150x119.png 150w, http://www.longfineel.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/signing-the-eel.png 631w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-223" class="wp-caption-text">Students signing the banner</p></div>
<p>A documentary slide show was played, highlighting the remarkable attributes of the Longfin eel, and the dilemma of possible extinction which it faces. Informative flyers, which the students had published, were handed out.</p>
<p>The students have collected over 400 signatures on their banner, and now are hoping that they can present their petition to somebody who will listen, and can help them achieve their goal of saving the Longfin eel.</p>

<p>Stephanie is working with groups in New Zealand and beyond to create a looooooooooong eel appliqué tapestry that will be displayed in public spaces throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>See how your school, class, group, family, etc. can be involved in creating a section of this ‘<a title="Travelling Tuna Tapestry" href="http://www.bowmansart.com/documents/MAKING%20%20ART%20%20TO%20%20SAVE%20%20THE%20%20LONGFIN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traveling Tuna Tapestry</a>’ for display all around New Zealand. Our goal is to make it long enough to wrap around the Beehive, sail it to Tonga, later return each section to the people who made it to keep as a korowai, and have the eels get national media attention!&#8221;</p>
